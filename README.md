## üîç Problem

On some versions of **Chrome on iOS**, the browser allows scrolling beyond the actual content height. As a result, elements like a sticky header or fixed bottom navbar become misplaced.

Specifically:
- The **`mobile_navbar`** (positioned with `fixed; bottom: 0;`) scrolls up.
- The page seems to have an **artificially doubled height**.
- This does **not** occur in Safari or on Android.

## üìÇ Files

- `index.html` ‚Äî A simple page with a fixed header and fixed bottom navbar.
- `style.css` ‚Äî Minimal styles to reproduce the issue.
- `/img/450px-Itoddlers-btfo.gif` ‚Äî An image to fill the page with contents.

## üß™ Reproduction Steps

1. Open `index.html` on **Chrome iOS**.
2. Scroll the page downward.
3. Observe that the bottom navbar (`mobile_navbar`) scrolls out of view, even though it‚Äôs `position: fixed`.
